"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) (1) Since 1899 congressionally chartered veterans’ organizations have provided a valuable service to our nation’s returning service members. These organizations help preserve the memories and incidents of the great hostilities fought by our nation, and preserve and strengthen comradeship among members.
(2) These veterans’ organizations also own and manage various properties including lodges, posts, and fraternal halls. These properties act as a safe haven where veterans of all ages and their families can gather together to find camaraderie and fellowship, share stories, and seek support from people who understand their unique experiences. This aids in the healing process for these returning veterans, and ensures their health and happiness.
(b) As a result of congressional chartering of these veterans’ organizations, the United States Internal Revenue Service created a special tax exemption for these organizations under Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(c) Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code and related federal regulations provide for the exemption for posts or organizations of war veterans, or an auxiliary unit or society of, or a trust or foundation for, any such post or organization that, among other attributes, carries on programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, conducts programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, sponsors or participates in activities of a patriotic nature, and provides social and recreational activities for their members.
(d) Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code stipulates that all buildings, support and so much of the real property on which the buildings are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the buildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans’ organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States, organized and operated for charitable purposes, when the same are used solely and exclusively for the purpose of the organization, if not conducted for profit and no part of the net earnings of which ensures to the benefit of any private individual or member thereof, are exempt from taxation.
(e) The Chief Counsel of the State Board of Equalization concluded, based on a 1979 appellate court decision, that only parts of American Legion halls are exempt from property taxation and that other parts, such as billiard rooms, card rooms, and similar areas, are not exempt.
(f) In a 1994 memorandum, the State Board of Equalization’s legal division further concluded that the areas normally considered eligible for exemptions are the office areas used to counsel veterans and the area used to store veterans’ records, but that the meeting hall and bar found in most of the facilities are not considered used for charitable purposes.
(g) Tax-exempt status is intended to provide economic incentive and support to veterans’ organizations to provide for the social welfare of the community of current and former military personnel.
(h) The State Board of Equalization’s constriction of the tax exemption has resulted in an onerous tax burden on California veteran service organizations posts or halls, hinders the posts’ ability to provide facilities for veterans, and threatens the economic viability of many local organizations.
(i) The charitable activities of a veteran service organizations post or hall are much more than the counseling of veterans. The requirements listed for qualification for the federal tax exemption clearly dictate a need for more than just an office.
(j) Programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors require the use of facilities for funerals and receptions.
(k) Programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes require space for more than 50 attendees.
(l) Activities of a patriotic nature need facilities to accommodate hundreds of people.
(m) Social and recreational activities for members require precisely those areas considered “not used for charitable purposes” by the State Board of Equalization.
(n) The State Board of Equalization’s interpretation of the Revenue and Taxation Code reflects a lack of understanding of the purpose and programs of the veterans service organizations posts or halls and is detrimental to the good works performed in support of our veteran community.

Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
215.1.
(a) All buildings, and so much of the real property on which the buildings are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the buildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans’ organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States, organized and operated for charitable purposes, and exempt from federal income tax as an organization described in Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code when the same are used solely and exclusively for the purpose of the organization, if not conducted for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private individual or member thereof, shall be exempt from taxation.
(b) The exemption provided for in this section shall apply to the property of all organizations meeting the requirements of this section, subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution, and paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive, (6), and (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 214.
(c) (1) The exemption specified by subdivision (a) shall not be denied to a property on the basis that the property is used for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes.
(2) With regard to this subdivision, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(A) The exempt activities of a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) qualitatively differ from the exempt activities of other nonprofit entities that use property for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes in that the exempt purpose of the veterans’ organization is to conduct programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, to conduct programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, to sponsor or participate in activities of a patriotic nature, and to provide social and recreational activities for their members.
(B) In light of this distinction, the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a), for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes is central to that organization’s exempt purposes and activities.
(C) In light of the factors set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes, constitutes the exclusive use of that property for a charitable purpose within the meaning of subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution.
(d) The exemption provided for in this section shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served. The portion of the property ineligible for the veterans’ organization exemption shall be that area used primarily to prepare and serve alcoholic beverages.
(e) An organization that files a claim for the exemption provided for in this section shall file with the assessor a valid organizational clearance certificate issued pursuant to Section 254.6.
(f) This exemption shall be known as the “veterans’ organization exemption.”

Notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made by this act and the state shall not reimburse any local agency for any property tax revenues lost by it pursuant to this act.

SEC. 4.
This act provides for a tax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.","Existing property tax law establishes a veterans’ organization exemption under which property is exempt from taxation if, among other things, that property is used exclusively for charitable purposes and is owned by a veterans’ organization.
This bill would provide that the veterans’ organization exemption shall not be denied to a property on the basis that the property is used for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes, and would make specific findings and declarations in that regard. The bill would also provide that the exemption shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served.
Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","An act to amend Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy."
"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 1170.02 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
1170.02.
A prisoner is not eligible for resentence or recall pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 1170 if he or she was convicted of first-degree murder if the victim was a peace officer, as defined in Section 830.1, 830.2, 830.3, 830.31, 830.32, 830.33, 830.34, 830.35, 830.36, 830.37, 830.4, 830.5, 830.6, 830.10, 830.11, or 830.12, who was killed while engaged in the performance of his or her duties, and the individual knew, or reasonably should have known, that the victim was a peace officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties, or the victim was a peace officer or a former peace officer under any of the above-enumerated sections, and was intentionally killed in retaliation for the performance of his or her official duties.
SEC. 2.
Section 3550 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
3550.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, except as provided in subdivision (b), if the head physician of an institution in which a prisoner is incarcerated determines, as provided in this section, that the prisoner is permanently medically incapacitated with a medical condition that renders him or her permanently unable to perform activities of basic daily living, and results in the prisoner requiring 24-hour care, and that incapacitation did not exist at the time of sentencing, the prisoner shall be granted medical parole if the Board of Parole Hearings determines that the conditions under which he or she would be released would not reasonably pose a threat to public safety.
(b) This section does not alter or diminish the rights conferred under the Victims’ Bill of Rights Act of 2008 (Marsy’s Law). Subdivision (a) does not apply to any of the following:
(1) A prisoner sentenced to death or life in prison without possibility of parole.
(2) A prisoner who is serving a sentence for which parole, pursuant to subdivision (a), is prohibited by any initiative statute.
(3) A prisoner who was convicted of first-degree murder if the victim was a peace officer, as defined in Section 830.1, 830.2, 830.3, 830.31, 830.32, 830.33, 830.34, 830.35, 830.36, 830.37, 830.4, 830.5, 830.6, 830.10, 830.11, or 830.12, who was killed while engaged in the performance of his or her duties, and the individual knew, or reasonably should have known, that the victim was a peace officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties, or the victim was a peace officer or a former peace officer under any of the above-enumerated sections, and was intentionally killed in retaliation for the performance of his or her official duties.
(c) When a physician employed by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation who is the primary care provider for a prisoner identifies a prisoner that he or she believes meets the medical criteria for medical parole specified in subdivision (a), the primary care physician shall recommend to the head physician of the institution where the prisoner is located that the prisoner be referred to the Board of Parole Hearings for consideration for medical parole. Within 30 days of receiving that recommendation, if the head physician of the institution concurs in the recommendation of the primary care physician, he or she shall refer the matter to the Board of Parole Hearings using a standardized form and format developed by the department, and if the head physician of the institution does not concur in the recommendation, he or she shall provide the primary care physician with a written explanation of the reasons for denying the referral.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the prisoner or his or her family member or designee may independently request consideration for medical parole by contacting the head physician at the prison or the department. Within 30 days of receiving the request, the head physician of the institution shall, in consultation with the prisoner’s primary care physician, make a determination regarding whether the prisoner meets the criteria for medical parole as specified in subdivision (a) and, if the head physician of the institution determines that the prisoner satisfies the criteria set forth in subdivision (a), he or she shall refer the matter to the Board of Parole Hearings using a standardized form and format developed by the department. If the head physician of the institution does not concur in the recommendation, he or she shall provide the prisoner or his or her family member or designee with a written explanation of the reasons for denying the application.
(e) The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall complete parole plans for inmates referred to the Board of Parole Hearings for medical parole consideration. The parole plans shall include, but not be limited to, the inmate’s plan for residency and medical care.
(f) Notwithstanding any other law, medical parole hearings shall be conducted by two-person panels consisting of at least one commissioner. In the event of a tie vote, the matter shall be referred to the full board for a decision. Medical parole hearings may be heard in absentia.
(g) Upon receiving a recommendation from the head physician of the institution where a prisoner is located for the prisoner to be granted medical parole pursuant to subdivision (c) or (d), the board, as specified in subdivision (f), shall make an independent judgment regarding whether the conditions under which the inmate would be released pose a reasonable threat to public safety, and make written findings related thereto.
(h) Notwithstanding any other law, the board or the Division of Adult Parole Operations shall have the authority to impose any reasonable conditions on prisoners subject to medical parole supervision pursuant to subdivision (a), including, but not limited to, the requirement that the parolee submit to electronic monitoring. As a further condition of medical parole, pursuant to subdivision (a), the parolee may be required to submit to an examination by a physician selected by the board for the purpose of diagnosing the parolee’s current medical condition. In the event such an examination takes place, a report of the examination and diagnosis shall be submitted to the board by the examining physician. If the board determines, based on that medical examination, that the person’s medical condition has improved to the extent that the person no longer qualifies for medical parole, the board shall return the person to the custody of the department.
(1) Notwithstanding any other law establishing maximum periods for parole, a prisoner sentenced to a determinate term who is placed on medical parole supervision prior to the earliest possible release date and who remains eligible for medical parole, shall remain on medical parole, pursuant to subdivision (a), until that earliest possible release date, at which time the parolee shall commence serving that period of parole provided by, and under the provisions of, Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 3000) of Title 1.
(2) Notwithstanding any other law establishing maximum periods for parole, a prisoner sentenced to an indeterminate term who is placed on medical parole supervision prior to the prisoner’s minimum eligible parole date, and who remains eligible for medical parole, shall remain on medical parole pursuant to subdivision (a) until that minimum eligible parole date, at which time the parolee shall be eligible for parole consideration under all other provisions of Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 3000) of Title 1.
(i) The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall, at the time a prisoner is placed on medical parole supervision pursuant to subdivision (a), ensure that the prisoner has applied for any federal entitlement programs for which the prisoner is eligible, and has in his or her possession a discharge medical summary, full medical records, parole medications, and all property belonging to the prisoner that was under the control of the department. Any additional records shall be sent to the prisoner’s forwarding address after release to health care-related parole supervision.
(j) The provisions for medical parole set forth in this title shall not affect an inmate’s eligibility for any other form of parole or release provided by law.
(k) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall give notice to the county of commitment and the proposed county of release, if that county is different than the county of commitment, of any medical parole hearing as described in subdivision (f), and of any medical parole release as described in subdivision (g).
(2) Notice shall be made at least 30 days, or as soon as feasible, prior to the time any medical parole hearing or medical parole release is scheduled for an inmate receiving medical parole consideration, regardless of whether the inmate is sentenced either determinately or indeterminately.","Existing law provides that the Board of Parole Hearings or its successor in interest shall be the state’s parole authority. Existing law requires that a prisoner who is found to be permanently medically incapacitated, as specified, be granted medical parole, if the Board of Parole Hearings determines that the conditions under which the prisoner would be released would not reasonably pose a threat to public safety. Existing law exempts a prisoner sentenced to death, a prisoner sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, and a prisoner who is serving a sentence for which parole is prohibited by initiative statute, from medical parole eligibility.
Existing law authorizes a court to resentence or recall the sentence of a prisoner if the court finds that the prisoner is terminally ill, as specified, or the prisoner is permanently medically incapacitated, as specified, and, in either case, the conditions under which the prisoner would be released or receive treatment do not pose a threat to public safety. Existing law exempts a prisoner sentenced to death or a term of life without the possibility of parole from eligibility for compassionate release pursuant to these provisions.
This bill would additionally exempt from medical parole eligibility and compassionate release eligibility a prisoner who was convicted of the first-degree murder of a peace officer or a person who had been a peace officer, as provided.","An act to amend Section 3550 of, and to add Section 1170.02 to, the Penal Code, relating to parole."
"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California has long been known as the land of opportunity, the republic of the future. But for too many of its residents the future is receding. Inequality continues to rise — even though California has one of the most progressive tax structures in the nation.
(b) Something more is needed; a new philosophy of governance that focuses on the overall progressive outcome that can be achieved through modernizing our tax system and investing in the means of upward mobility, above all job creating infrastructure and public higher education for our increasingly youthful population.
(c) Beyond these foundations, building and sustaining a middle class means new jobs with good wages. Small businesses, like plumbing contractors, auto repair shops, and restaurants that account for over 90 percent of the state’s businesses and well over a third of all jobs, are a key rung on the ladder of upward mobility. They need a tax policy that will enable them to grow and add employees.
(d) California’s two trillion dollar economy has shifted from being mainly agricultural and manufacturing in the 1950s and 1960s, when the framework of today’s tax system was set, to one based on information and services, which now accounts for 80 percent of all economic activities in the state. To achieve a future as promising as California’s past, we need a tax system that is based on this real economy of the 21st century while ensuring that new revenue is invested in strengthening the ladder of mobility for all our residents.
(e) California of the 1950s and 1960s was governed with an eye towards the future and was renowned for the opportunities that it created for its residents. California’s water system was born during that era and transformed the desert into fertile agricultural land that not only fed Californians but the world. California also constructed its freeway system to more rapidly and safely move people and goods through the state as California became the gateway to the Pacific Rim. California’s higher education system was the envy of all, reaching new heights as the University of California and the California State University grew by six and eight campuses respectively between 1958 and 1965. California’s investment in infrastructure and education paid off as agriculture, aerospace, and then technology boomed and drove California into the 21st century as the fifth largest economy in the world. As businesses thrived, they created an abundance of middle class jobs that enabled Californians to capitalize on new opportunities to better the standard of living for themselves and their families.
(f) As California’s economy thrived, however, its eye on the future wavered. By the late 1970s, state and local finances became intertwined; the state increasingly used its funds to support traditionally local operations and both state and local governments pulled back on the types of investments needed to help businesses and residents succeed. Today, Californians live with the investments made more than three generations ago. Fifty-five percent of our local streets need to be repaired or replaced. While the state’s water system received some funding in 2014, more is needed to meet the state’s demands.
(g) On a local level, 70 percent of Los Angeles’ water infrastructure is composed of cast-iron pipes, most of which was laid during the early half of the 20th century.
(h) Our financial commitment to kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, education has waned. Average Daily Attendance grew anemically by 0.06 percent annually between 2007 and 2011. By 2011, California ranked 43rd in per pupil spending and California’s ADA was $2,580 less than the United States average — the largest gap in 40 years.
(i) California’s commitment to higher education has also receded. In addition to opening professional and economic doorways for students, California’s higher education system is one of our most important economic engines. With almost 60 faculty and researchers who have won the Nobel prize, the University of California has over 3,200 active patents and contributes $33 billion to the California economy annually. The California State University generates an additional $17 billion in economic activity and supports 150,000 jobs in the state. Despite its proven value, California has not been able to maintain higher education accessibility for its residents. In the past 20 years, University of California fees have increased by 434 percent and California State University fees by 300 percent. Moreover, California community colleges, the largest provider of workforce training in the nation, increased fees by 130 percent between 2008 and 2012, leading to over a 20 percent decline in enrollment.
(j) The lack of investment in infrastructure and education has diminished opportunities for Californians and continues to fuel the growing income inequality in California. Since 1970, the poorest 20 percent of Californians have seen their household income grow by just 3.1 percent while the income of the richest 20 percent has climbed 74.6 percent. Since 1987, 71.3 percent of all the gains generated by California’s economy have gone to the state’s wealthiest 10 percent. Moreover, today, California accounts for three of the 10 American cities with the greatest disparities in wealth—San Francisco, Oakland, and Los Angeles.
(k) (1) The Upward Mobility Act would help ensure California’s residents and businesses can thrive in the 21st century global economy by increasing funding by $10 billion dollars for the following programs, as the revenue becomes available:
(A) Three billion dollars to K-14 education. Investing in its residents through education is the foundation on which California has always built its economy. This measure would provide new funds to help rebuild California’s education system at every level. The new revenues will help to rebuild classrooms and be available to help protect classroom spending from pending pension fund demands.
(B) Two billion dollars to the University of California and the California State University. Similarly, the measure would restore investment in California’s prized higher education system, essential to upward mobility for Californians. Revenues would be split evenly between the University of California and the California State University.
(C) Three billion dollars to local governments. Investing in local governments will more closely connect Californians to the government spending that occurs on their behalf and support the new realignment burdens on local government. Moreover, additional guaranteed funding to provide additional public safety, parks, libraries, or local development, will allow local governments to best meet the specific needs of their particular communities.
(D) Two billion
dollars
for a new earned income tax credit for low-income families. The Upward Mobility Act would establish a refundable earned income tax credit to help low-income families offset the burden of the proposed sales and use tax on services.
(E) Small business and minimum wage relief. This measure would enhance the state’s business climate, create jobs, and incentivize entrepreneurship by evaluating the current corporate income tax to determine whether it is meeting its intended purpose while at the same time linking changes to a more reasonable minimum wage.
(2) Because this funding would be guaranteed, school districts, community colleges, the California State University, the University of California, and local governments would be able to securitize the revenues to make essential long-term investments, just as is the case with real property taxes.
(l) The Upward Mobility Act will fund these programs to enable the upward mobility of our residents and to help make California’s businesses more competitive by modernizing our tax code. The underlying problem is, while California’s economy has evolved, its tax system failed to keep up with the times. Over the past 60 years, California has moved from an agriculture and manufacturing based economy to a services based economy. As a result, state tax revenues have become less reliant on revenues derived from the Sales and Use Tax on goods and more reliant on revenues derived from the Personal Income Tax. In 1950, the Sales and Use Tax comprised 61 percent of all state revenues; today, it accounts for about 30 percent. The Personal Income Tax accounted for 12 percent of total state revenues in 1950; today, it accounts for more than 60 percent.
(m) Moreover, California’s General Fund tax collections are heavily dependent on the earnings of its top earners. This has led to dramatic revenue swings year over year. During the dot-com economic boom of the
1950s
1990s
through the early part of the 21st century, state revenues soared by as much as 20 percent in a single year. However, as personal incomes tumbled during the Great Recession, state revenues plummeted disproportionately. These swings in revenue have led to the suffering of California’s residents. Essential services, such as health care and child care for low-income families, were cut at a time when they were needed most. In addition, the state cut billions of dollars to education, including adult vocational and literacy education, which could have helped low-income families recover from the recession. Relying on the wealthiest taxpayers to support California’s needs is outdated and dangerous fiscal policy. Not only does it increase the uncertainty of tax collections, but there is evidence that California’s high tax rates may be driving high income earners out of the state, which only deepens revenue shortfalls.
(n) The economy has shifted away from the production of goods to services. Since 1966 sales of taxable goods, as a share of the economy, have been cut in half. Today services represent 80 percent of California’s economy. Expanding the Sales and Use Tax to cover services removes a significant inequitable aspect of the tax code, implicitly favoring consumer spending on services over goods. Currently the sale of a TurboTax software disk is taxed, whereas a consumer who instead paid H&R Block would escape taxation. In essence, those who produce goods such as software or machinery are supporting those who produce services and information. Taxing only goods and not services when our economy has been so fundamentally transformed makes no sense and is manifestly unfair. This has to change.
(o) The Upward Mobility Act seeks to make three broad changes to the tax code:
(1) Broaden the tax base by imposing a sales tax on services to increase revenues. Local jurisdictions would not be authorized to increase sales tax on services, as they now can do with the sales tax on goods. Though the new revenues would be collected by the state, the ownership of those funds allocated to local government under this measure will be controlled by local government using traditional allocation mechanisms. Health care services and education services would be exempted from the tax, and very small businesses with under $100,000 gross sales would be exempted from the sales tax on services.
(2) Enhance the state’s business climate and incentivize entrepreneurship and business creation by evaluating the corporate income tax to determine whether it is meeting its intended purposes, including whether it is
born
borne
equitably among California’s businesses and what impact it has on the business climate, while at the same time linking changes to a more reasonable minimum wage.
(3) Examine the impacts of lowering and simplifying the
Personal Income Tax
personal income tax
while maintaining progressivity. The measure’s goal is to reduce
the income tax rates imposed under the Personal Income Tax
personal income tax rates
for low-and middle-class-income households so that families earning $100,000 pay only $1,000. The income tax rate for top earners may also be reduced in a manner that balances fairness with mitigating adverse impact to both state revenues and competitiveness. The obligation of top earners with regard to other tax obligations for top earners, including Proposition 63, would remain intact.
(p) In order to ensure fiscal responsibility, the Upward Mobility Act’s revenue reduction provisions would be phased in only when it is clear that new revenues are sufficient to replace any revisions to the personal income tax and corporate tax.
(q) As the revenues secured by Proposition 30 expire, California policy decisionmakers must determine new long term ways to provide for state residents. The Upward Mobility Act will increase opportunities for California’s businesses and create an upward mobility ladder for California residents. Moreover, the Upward Mobility Act will realign the state’s outdated tax code with the realities of California’s 21st century economy.

SEC. 4.
Section 75223 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
75223.
(a) The Transportation Agency shall conduct at least two public workshops on draft program guidelines containing selection criteria prior to approval and shall post the draft guidelines on the agency’s Internet Web site at least 30 days prior to the first public workshop. Concurrent with the posting, the agency shall transmit the draft guidelines to the fiscal committees and the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature.

Existing law establishes the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program, which receives 10% of the annual proceeds of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as a continuous appropriation, to fund capital improvements and operational investments to modernize California’s rail systems to achieve certain policy objectives, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, expanding and improving rail services to increase ridership, and improving rail safety. Existing law requires the Transportation Agency to evaluate applications for funding under the program and to prepare a list of projects recommended for funding, with grants to be awarded by the California Transportation Commission.
This bill would modify the purpose of the program to delete references to operational investments and instead provide for the funding of transformative capital improvements, as defined, that will modernize California’s intercity, commuter, and urban rail systems and bus and ferry transit systems to achieve certain policy objectives, including reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, expanding and improving transit services to increase ridership, and improving transit safety. By expanding the purposes for which continuously appropriated moneys may be used, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would modify the information required to be included in applications for grants under the program and would authorize an eligible applicant to submit an application to fund a project over multiple fiscal years and to submit multiple applications. The bill would require the Transportation Agency, in selecting projects for funding, to consider the extent to which a project reduces greenhouse gas emissions, would add additional factors to be considered in evaluating applications for funding, and would expand certain factors considered to include bus and ferry transit service. The bill would require the Transportation Agency to approve, by July 1, 2018, a 5-year program of projects, and would require the California Transportation Commission to allocate funding to eligible applicants pursuant to the program of projects, with subsequent programs of projects to be approved not later than April 1 of each even-numbered year thereafter. The bill would require the Transportation Agency, in cooperation with the California Transportation Commission and at the request of an eligible applicant, to enter into and execute a multiyear funding agreement for a project to be funded over more than one fiscal year, as specified, and would authorize the California Transportation Commission to approve a letter of no prejudice that would allow an applicant to expend its own moneys on a project in the approved program of projects, subject to future reimbursement from program moneys for eligible expenditures.","An act to amend Sections 75220, 75221, and 75222 of, and to add Sections 75223, 75224, and 75225 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to transportation, and making an appropriation therefor."
"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the California POLST eRegistry Pilot Act.
SEC. 2.
Section 4788 is added to the Probate Code, to read:
4788.
(a)    For purposes of this section:
(1) “Authority” means the Emergency Medical Services Authority.
(2) “Authorized user” means a person authorized by the authority to submit information to, or to receive information from, the POLST eRegistry Pilot, including health care providers, as defined in Section 4781, and their designees.
(3) “POLST” means a Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment that fulfills the requirements, in any format, of Section 4780.
(4) “POLST eRegistry Pilot” means the California POLST eRegistry Pilot Act established pursuant to this section to make electronic, in addition to other modes of submission and transmission, POLST information available to authorized users.
(b) (1) The authority shall establish a pilot project, in consultation with stakeholders, to operate an electronic registry system on a pilot basis, to be known as the California POLST eRegistry Pilot, for the purpose of collecting a patient’s POLST information received from a physician or physician’s designee and disseminating the information to an authorized user.
(2) The authority shall implement this section only after determining that sufficient nonstate funds are available to allow for the development of the POLST eRegistry Pilot, any related startup costs, and an evaluation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot.
(3) The authority shall coordinate the POLST eRegistry Pilot, which shall be operated by, and as a part of, the health information exchange networks, or by an independent contractor, or by a combination thereof. The POLST eRegistry Pilot may operate in a single geographic area or multiple geographic areas and may test various methods of making POLST information available electronically. The design of the POLST eRegistry Pilot shall be sufficiently robust, based on the success of the pilot, to inform the permanent, statewide operation of a POLST eRegistry.
(4) The authority shall adopt guidelines necessary for the operation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot. In developing these guidelines, the authority shall seek input from interested parties and hold at least one public meeting. The adoption, amendment, or repeal of the guidelines authorized by this paragraph is hereby exempted from the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code). The guidelines shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(A) The means by which initial or subsequent POLST information may be submitted to, or withdrawn from, the POLST eRegistry Pilot, which shall include a method for electronic delivery of this information and the use of legally sufficient electronic signatures.
(B) Appropriate and timely methods by which the information in the POLST eRegistry Pilot may be disseminated to an authorized user.
(C) Procedures for verifying the identity of an authorized user.
(D) Procedures to ensure the accuracy of, and to appropriately protect the confidentiality of, POLST information submitted to the POLST eRegistry Pilot.
(E) The requirement that a patient, or, when appropriate, his or her legally recognized health care decisionmaker, receive a confirmation or a receipt that the patient’s POLST information has been received by the POLST eRegistry Pilot.
(F) The ability of a patient, or, when appropriate, his or her legally recognized health care decisionmaker, with his or her health care provider, as defined in Section 4621, to modify or withdraw POLST information on the POLST eRegistry Pilot.
(6) (A) Prior to implementation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot, the authority shall submit a detailed plan to the Legislature that explains how the POLST eRegistry Pilot will operate.
(B) The plan to be submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(c) The operation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot, for all users, shall comply with state and federal privacy and security laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, compliance with the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (Part 2.6 (commencing with Section 56) of Division 1 of the Civil Code) and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191), found at Parts 160 and 164 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
(d) When the POLST eRegistry Pilot is operable in the geographic area in which he or she practices or operates, a physician or physician’s designee who completes POLST information with a patient or his or her legally recognized health care decisionmaker shall include the POLST information in the patient’s official medical record and shall submit a copy of the POLST form to, or enter the POLST information into, the POLST eRegistry Pilot, unless the patient or the legally recognized health care decisionmaker chooses not to participate in the POLST eRegistry Pilot.
(e) When the POLST eRegistry Pilot is operable in the geographic area in which they practice or operate, physicians, hospitals, and health information exchange networks shall make electronic POLST information available, for use during emergencies, through the POLST eRegistry Pilot to health care providers, as defined in Section 4781, that also practice or operate in a geographic area where the POLST eRegistry Pilot is operable, but that are outside of their health information exchange networks.
(f) In accordance with Section 4782, a health care provider, as defined in Section 4781, who honors a patient’s request regarding resuscitative measures obtained from the POLST eRegistry Pilot shall not be subject to criminal prosecution, civil liability, discipline for unprofessional conduct, administrative sanction, or any other sanction, if the health care provider (1) believes in good faith that the action or decision is consistent with this part, and (2) has no knowledge that the action or decision would be inconsistent with a health care decision that the individual signing the request would have made on his or her own behalf under like circumstances.
(g) An independent contractor approved by the authority shall perform an evaluation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot.
(h) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law defines a request regarding resuscitative measures as a written document, signed by an individual with capacity, or a legally recognized health care decisionmaker, and the individual’s physician, directing a health care provider regarding resuscitative measures. Existing law defines a Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment form, which is commonly referred to as a POLST form, and provides that a request regarding resuscitative measures includes a POLST form. Existing law requires that a POLST form and the medical intervention and procedures offered by the form be explained by a health care provider. Existing law distinguishes a request regarding resuscitative measures from an advance health care directive.
This bill would enact the California POLST eRegistry Pilot Act. The bill would require the Emergency Medical Services Authority to establish a pilot project, in consultation with stakeholders, to operate an electronic registry system on a pilot basis, to be known as the California POLST eRegistry Pilot, for the purpose of collecting POLST information received from a physician or physician’s designee. The bill would require the authority to coordinate the POLST eRegistry Pilot, which would be operated by health information exchange networks, by an independent contractor, or by a combination thereof. The bill would require the authority to implement these provisions only after it determines that sufficient nonstate funds are available for development of the POLST eRegistry Pilot, any related startup costs, and an evaluation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot. When the POLST eRegistry Pilot is operable in the geographic area in which he or she operates or practices, a physician or physician’s designee who completes POLST information would be required to include the POLST information in the patient’s official medical record and would be required to submit a copy of the form to, or to enter the information into, the POLST eRegistry Pilot, unless a patient or his or her health care decisionmaker chooses not to participate in the POLST eRegistry Pilot. The bill would require the authority to adopt guidelines for, among other things, the operation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot, including the means by which POLST information would be submitted electronically, modified, or withdrawn, the appropriate and timely methods for dissemination of POLST form information, the procedures for verifying the identity of an authorized user, and rules for maintaining the confidentiality of POLST information received by the POLST eRegistry Pilot. The bill would require that any disclosure of POLST information in the POLST eRegistry Pilot be made in accordance with applicable state and federal privacy and security laws and regulations. The bill would provide immunity from criminal prosecution, civil liability, discipline for unprofessional conduct, and any other sanction for a health care provider who honors a patient’s request regarding resuscitative measures obtained from the POLST eRegistry Pilot, as specified. The bill would require an independent contractor approved by the authority to conduct an evaluation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot. The provisions of the bill would be operative until January 1, 2020.","An act to add and repeal Section 4788 of the Probate Code, relating to resuscitative measures."

The Legislature finds and declares that this bill furthers the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 81012 of the Government Code.","The Political Reform Act of 1974 provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign financing and related matters, including the reporting of gifts, as defined. The act prohibits specified officers from receiving gifts in excess of $440 in value from a single source in a calendar year. The act exempts gift payments for the actual costs of specified types of travel that are reasonably related to a legislative or governmental purpose, or to an issue of state, national, or international public policy, from the annual limit on the value of gifts from a single source.
This bill would require a nonprofit organization that regularly organizes and hosts travel for elected officials, as specified, and that pays for these types of travel for an elected state officer or local elected officeholder to disclose the names of donors who, in the preceding year, both donated to the nonprofit organization and accompanied an elected officer or officeholder for any portion of the travel, as specified. The bill would require a person who receives a gift of a travel payment from any source to report the travel destination on his or her statement of economic interests.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 87207 of the Government Code proposed by both this bill and AB 10, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
A violation of the act’s provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(a) More than $40 million of funding for the training of California’s primary care physicians is expiring in 2016.
(b) Each year in California, only 368 slots are available to the thousands of medical students seeking to train in family medicine. If the funding is not replaced, 158 of those slots will be lost, creating a terrible deficit of primary care physicians in California’s underserved communities.
(c) Only 36 percent of California’s active patient care physicians practice primary care. Twenty-three of California’s 58 counties fall below the minimum required primary care physician to population ratio.
(d) As of 2010, California needed an estimated additional 8,243 primary care physicians by 2030 to prevent projected shortages in the state, which is about 412 new primary care physicians per year.
(e) More than 32 percent of California’s practicing primary care physicians are 60 years of age or older – only four other states have a larger percentage of soon-to-retire physicians.
(f) States with higher ratios of primary care physicians to population have better health outcomes, including decreased mortality from cancer, heart disease, and stroke.
(g) The Song-Brown program provides an existing state infrastructure to support an increase in the number of primary care providers serving California’s underserved populations. By investing in Song-Brown, California will realize an immediate return on investment as each primary care resident provides an average of 600 additional patient visits per physician per year during training alone.
(h) California’s long-term workforce will also grow significantly as the vast majority of physicians who train in a region stay there to practice. California leads all fifty states in the percentage of residency program graduates who stay in the state in which they are trained.

SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Article 7 (commencing with Section 128590) to Chapter 5 of Part 3 of Division 107 of the Health and Safety Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
The need to protect individual privacy of donations made by a donor to fund new medical residency positions in underserved areas of the state outweighs the interest in the public disclosure of that information.","The Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Act creates a state medical contract program to increase the number of students and residents receiving quality education and training in specified primary care specialties or in nursing, and to maximize the delivery of primary care and family physician services to specific areas of California where there is a recognized unmet priority need for those services. The act requires the Director of Statewide Health Planning and Development to, among other things, contract with accredited medical schools, teaching health centers, training programs, hospitals, and other health care delivery systems for those purposes, based on recommendations of the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission and in conformity with the contract criteria and program standards established by the commission.
This bill would appropriate $300,000,000 from the General Fund to the director for the purpose of funding new and existing graduate medical education physician residency positions, and supporting training faculty, pursuant to the act, for expenditure as specified. The bill would also make related findings and declarations.
Existing law, the Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Act, declares the intent of the Legislature to increase the number of students and residents receiving quality education and training in the specialty of family practice and as primary care physician’s assistants and primary care nurse practitioners. Existing law establishes, for this purpose, a state medical contract program with accredited medical schools, programs that train primary care physician’s assistants, programs that train primary care nurse practitioners, registered nurses, hospitals, and other health care delivery systems.
Existing law requires the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development to establish the Health Professions Education Foundation to solicit and receive funds for the purpose of providing financial assistance in the form of scholarships or loans to medical students from underrepresented groups. Under existing law, the foundation also administers other programs for the advancement of health professions, including the Registered Nurse Education Program.
This bill would establish the Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel, consisting of a total of 13 members to be appointed as specified, within the Health Professions Education Foundation.
The bill would create the Medical Residency Training Fund in the State Treasury, a continuously appropriated fund, and would require the panel to solicit and accept funds from business, industry, foundations, and other private or public sources for the purpose of establishing and funding new graduate medical residency training programs in specified areas of the state, including medically underserved areas. By creating a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would require the foundation to provide technical support and financial management for the panel and to approve and send panel recommendations for new residency programs to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development for implementation if specified requirements are met, including sufficient funding. The bill would require the office to enter into contracts with public and private sector institutions and other health agencies and organizations in order to fund and establish recommended residency positions. The bill would authorize the Governor to include in the annual budget proposal an amount, as he or she deems reasonable, to be appropriated for this purpose. The bill, if the Legislature appropriates money for this purpose, would require the office to hold the funds and distribute them into the fund, upon request of the panel, in an amount matching the amount deposited into the fund, as specified. The bill would require money that was appropriated, but that has not been distributed to the fund at the end of each fiscal year, to be returned to the General Fund.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act
to add Article 7 (commencing with Section 128590) to Chapter 5 of Part 3 of Division 107 of the Health and Safety Code,
relating to health care, and making an appropriation therefor."
"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Scientific research has demonstrated that young children living in deep poverty experience lifelong cognitive impairments limiting their ability to be prepared for, and succeed in, school.
(b) Academic research has documented an increase in missed days of school and an increase in visits to hospital emergency rooms by children who live in deep poverty.
(c) The Maximum Family Grant rule was adopted to limit the length of time a family could receive basic needs assistance, and to limit the amount of assistance a family could receive, through the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program before the implementation of welfare reform. At the time the rule was adopted, there was no limit on the length of time a family could receive aid, no work requirements, and the benefits provided were approximately 80 percent of the federal poverty level.
(d) Since the implementation of the Maximum Family Grant rule, AFDC has been replaced with the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids Act (CalWORKs), which imposes lifetime limits on aid and requires adult CalWORKs participants to meet work requirements in order to receive a maximum benefit of approximately 40 percent of the federal poverty level.
(e) The Maximum Family Grant rule makes poor children poorer, reducing the income of families with infants to below 30 percent of the federal poverty level.
(f) This act is necessary to protect infants born to families receiving CalWORKs from experiencing lifelong cognitive impairments due to the toxic stress of deep poverty and to ready those children for participation in California’s public school system.
(g) This act is also necessary to protect the reproductive and privacy rights of all applicants for, and recipients of, aid under CalWORKs.
SEC. 2.
Section 11270.5 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, immediately following Section 11270, to read:
11270.5.
(a) An applicant for, or recipient of, aid under this chapter shall not be required, as a condition of eligibility, to do any of the following:
(1) Divulge that any member of the assistance unit is a victim of rape or incest.
(2) Share confidential medical records related to any member of the assistance unit’s rape or incest.
(3) Use contraception, choose a particular method of contraception, or divulge the method of contraception that any member of the assistance unit uses.
(b) An applicant for, or recipient of, aid under this chapter shall not be denied aid, nor denied an increase in the maximum aid payment, for a child born into the applicant’s or recipient’s family during a period in which the applicant’s or recipient’s family was receiving aid under this chapter.
(c) An applicant for, or recipient of, aid under this chapter shall not be entitled to an increased benefit payment for any month prior to January 1, 2016, as a result of the repeal of former Section 11450.04 (as added by Section 1 of Chapter 196 of the Statutes of 1994) or the enactment of this section.
SEC. 3.
Section 11450.04 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is repealed.
11450.04.
(a)For purposes of determining the maximum aid payment specified in subdivision (a) of Section 11450 and for no other purpose, the number of needy persons in the same family shall not be increased for any child born into a family that has received aid under this chapter continuously for the 10 months prior to the birth of the child. For purposes of this section, aid shall be considered continuous unless the family does not receive aid during two consecutive months. This subdivision shall not apply to applicants for, or recipients of, aid unless notification is provided pursuant to this section.
(b)This section shall not apply with respect to any of the following children:
(1)Any child who was conceived as a result of an act of rape, as defined in Sections 261 and 262 of the Penal Code, if the rape was reported to a law enforcement agency, medical or mental health professional or social services agency prior to, or within three months after, the birth of the child.
(2)Any child who was conceived as a result of an incestuous relationship if the relationship was reported to a medical or mental health professional or a law enforcement agency or social services agency prior to, or within three months after, the birth of the child, or if paternity has been established.
(3)Any child who was conceived as a result of contraceptive failure if the parent was using an intrauterine device, a Norplant, or the sterilization of either parent.
(c)This section shall not apply to any child born on or before November 1, 1995.
(d)(1)This section shall not apply to any child to whom it would otherwise apply if the family has not received aid for 24 consecutive months while the child was living with the family.
(2)This section shall not apply to any child conceived when either parent was a nonneedy caretaker relative.
(3)This section shall not apply to any child who is no longer living in the same home with either parent.
(e)One hundred percent of any child support payment received for a child born into the family, but for whom the maximum aid payment is not increased pursuant to this section, shall be paid to the assistance unit. Any such child support payment shall not be considered as income to the family for the purpose of calculating the amount of aid for which the family is eligible under this article.
(f)Commencing January 1, 1995, each county welfare department shall notify applicants for assistance under this chapter, in writing, of the provisions of this section. The notification shall also be provided to recipients of aid under this chapter, in writing, at the time of recertification, or sooner. The notification required by this section shall set forth the provisions of this section and shall state explicitly the impact these provisions would have on the future aid to the assistance unit. This section shall not apply to any recipient’s child earlier than 12 months after the mailing of an informational notice as required by this subdivision.
(g)(1)The department shall seek all appropriate federal waivers for the implementation of this section.
(2)The department shall implement this section commencing on the date the Director of Social Services executes a declaration, that shall be retained by the director, stating that the administrative actions required by paragraph (1) as a condition of implementation of this section have been taken by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.
(h)Subdivisions (a) to (g), inclusive, shall become operative on January 1, 1995.
SEC. 4.
No appropriation pursuant to Section 15200 of the Welfare and Institutions Code shall be made for the purposes of this act.
SEC. 5.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant program, state, and county funds. Under existing law, for purposes of determining a family’s maximum aid payment under the CalWORKs program, the number of needy persons in the same family is not increased for any child born into a family that has received aid under the CalWORKs program continuously for the 10 months prior to the birth of the child, with specified exceptions.
This bill would repeal that exclusion for purposes of determining the family’s maximum aid payment and would expressly prohibit the denial of aid, or the denial of an increase in the maximum aid payment, if a child, on whose behalf aid or an increase in aid is being requested, was born into an applicant’s or recipient’s family while the applicant’s or recipient’s family was receiving aid under the CalWORKs program. The bill would specify that an applicant or recipient is not entitled to an increased benefit payment for any month prior to January 1, 2016, as a result of the repeal of that exclusion or the enactment of that express prohibition. The bill would also prohibit the department from conditioning an applicant’s or recipient’s eligibility for aid on the applicant’s or recipient’s disclosure of information regarding rape, incest, or contraception, as specified, or the applicant’s or recipient’s use of contraception.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county aid grant costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would declare that no appropriation would be made for purposes of the bill.
To the extent that this bill affects eligibility under the CalWORKs program, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 11270.5 to, and to repeal Section 11450.04 of, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to CalWORKs."
"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.

7522.02.
(a) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, except as provided in this article, on and after January 1, 2013, this article shall apply to all state and local public retirement systems and to their participating employers, including the Public Employees’ Retirement System, the State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Legislators’ Retirement System, the Judges’ Retirement System, the Judges’ Retirement System II, county and district retirement systems created pursuant to the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 3), independent public retirement systems, and to individual retirement plans offered by public employers.

The administration of the requirements of this article shall comply with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this article shall not apply to the entities described in Section 9 of Article IX of, and Sections 4 and 5 of Article XI of, the California Constitution, except to the extent that these entities continue to be participating employers in any retirement system governed by state statute. Accordingly, any retirement plan approved before January 1, 2013, by the voters of any entity excluded from coverage by this section shall not be affected by this article.
(3) (A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this article shall not apply to a public employee whose interests are protected under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code until a federal district court rules that the United States Secretary of Labor, or his or her designee, erred in determining that the application of this article precludes certification under that section, or until January 1, 2016, whichever is sooner.
(B) If a federal district court upholds the determination of the United States Secretary of Labor, or his or her designee, that application of this article precludes him or her from providing a certification under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code, this article shall not apply to a public employee specified in subparagraph (A).
(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this article shall not apply to a multiemployer plan authorized by Section 302(c)(5) of the federal Taft-Hartley Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 186(c)(5)) if the public employer began participation in that plan prior to January 1, 2013, and the plan is regulated by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et seq.).
(b) The benefit plan required by this article shall apply to public employees who are new members as defined in Section 7522.04.
(c) (1) Individuals who were employed by any public employer before January 1, 2013, and who became employed by a subsequent public employer for the first time on or after January 1, 2013, shall be subject to the retirement plan that would have been available to employees of the subsequent employer who were first employed by the subsequent employer on or before December 31, 2012, if the individual was subject to concurrent membership for which creditable service was performed in the previous six months or reciprocity established under any of the following provisions:
(A) Article 5 (commencing with Section 20350) of Chapter 3 of Part 3 of Division 5 of Title 2.

(d) If a public employer, before January 1, 2013, offers a defined benefit pension plan that provides a defined benefit formula with a lower benefit factor at normal retirement age and results in a lower normal cost than the defined benefit formula required by this article, that employer may continue to offer that defined benefit formula instead of the defined benefit formula required by this article, and shall not be subject to the requirements of Section 7522.10 for pensionable compensation subject to that formula. However, if the employer adopts a new defined benefit formula on or after January 1, 2013, that formula must conform to the requirements of this article or must be determined and certified by the retirement system’s chief actuary and the retirement board to have no greater risk and no greater cost to the employer than the defined benefit formula required by this article and must be approved by the Legislature. New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a defined benefit formula that conforms to the requirements of this article or is approved by the Legislature as provided in this subdivision.
(e) If a public employer, before January 1, 2013, offers a retirement benefit plan that consists solely of a defined contribution plan, that employer may continue to offer that plan instead of the defined benefit pension plan required by this article. However, if the employer adopts a new defined benefit pension plan or defined benefit formula on or after January 1, 2013, that plan or formula must conform to the requirements of this article or must be determined and certified by the retirement system’s chief actuary and the system’s board to have no greater risk and no greater cost to the employer than the defined benefit formula required by this article and must be approved by the Legislature.

This subdivision shall not be construed to prohibit an employer from offering a defined contribution plan on or after January 1, 2013, either with or without a defined benefit plan, whether or not the employer offered a defined contribution plan prior to that date.
(f) (1) If, on or after January 1, 2013, the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority pursuant to the provisions of the Joint Exercise of Powers Act (Article 1 (commencing with Section 6500) of Chapter 5), that joint powers authority may provide employees the defined benefit plan or formula that those employees received from their respective employers prior to the exercise of a common power, to which the employee is associated, by the joint powers authority to any employee of the City of Brea, the City of Fullerton, or a city described in paragraph (2) who is not a new member and subsequently is employed by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the city providing for the exercise of a common power, to which the employee was associated, by the joint powers authority.

(2) The formation of a joint powers authority on or after January 1, 2013, shall not act in a manner as to exempt a new employee or a new member, as defined by Section 7522.04, from the requirements of this article. New members may only participate in a defined benefit plan or formula that conforms to the requirements of this article.
(h) The Judges’ Retirement System and the Judges’ Retirement System II shall not be required to adopt the defined benefit formula required by Section 7522.20 or 7522.25 or the compensation limitations defined in Section 7522.10.
(i) This article shall not be construed to provide membership in any public retirement system for an individual who would not otherwise be eligible for membership under that system’s applicable rules or laws.
(j) On and after January 1, 2013, each public retirement system shall modify its plan or plans to comply with the requirements of this article and may adopt regulations or resolutions for this purpose.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the need to clarify the benefit eligibility rules under the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 and maintain the integrity of that act and further its purpose.","The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with the act and, among other provisions, establishes new retirement formulas that may not be exceeded by a public employer offering a defined benefit pension plan for employees first hired on or after January 1, 2013. Existing law, the Joint Exercise of Powers Act, generally authorizes 2 or more public agencies, by agreement, to jointly exercise any common power, which may include hiring employees and establishing retirement systems. PEPRA authorizes a joint powers authority formed by the Cities of Brea and Fullerton on or after January 1, 2013, to provide its employees the defined benefit plan or formula that those employees received from their respective employers prior to the exercise of a common power, to which the employee is associated, by the joint powers authority to any employee of specified cities who is not a new member and subsequently is employed by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the city providing for the exercise of a common power, to which the employee was associated, by the joint powers authority.
This bill would authorize a joint powers authority formed by the Belmont Fire Protection District, the Estero Municipal Improvement District, and the City of San Mateo on or after January 1, 2013, to provide employees who are not new members under PEPRA with the defined benefit plan or formula that was received by those employees from their respective employers on December 31, 2012, if they are employed by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the agency providing for the exercise of a common power, to which the employee was associated, by the joint powers authority. The bill would prohibit the formation of a joint powers authority on or after January 1, 2013, in a manner that would exempt a new employee or a new member from the requirements of PEPRA.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Belmont Fire Protection District, the Estero Municipal Improvement District, and the City of San Mateo.","An act to amend Section 7522.02 of the Government Code, relating to public employees’ retirement."

SECTION 1.
Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 14400) is added to Division 7 of the Food and Agricultural Code, to read:
CHAPTER  4.5. Livestock: Use of Antimicrobial Drugs
14400.
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
(a) “Medically important antimicrobial drug” means an antimicrobial drug listed in Appendix A of the federal Food and Drug Administration’s Guidance for Industry #152, including critically important, highly important, and important antimicrobial drugs, as that appendix may be amended.
(b) “Livestock” means all animals and poultry, including aquatic and amphibian species, that are raised, kept, or used for profit. Livestock does not include bees or those species that are usually kept as pets, such as dogs, cats, and pet birds.
(c) “Veterinary feed directive” has the same definition as in Section 558.3 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
14401.
Beginning January 1, 2018, a medically important antimicrobial drug shall not be administered to livestock unless ordered by a licensed veterinarian through a prescription or veterinary feed directive, pursuant to a veterinarian-client-patient relationship that meets the requirements of Section 2032.1 of Title 16 of the California Code of Regulations.
14402.
(a) Beginning January 1, 2018, a medically important antimicrobial drug may be used when, in the professional judgment of a licensed veterinarian, the medically important antimicrobial drug is any of the following:
(1) Necessary to treat a disease or infection.
(2) Necessary to control the spread of a disease or infection.
(3) Necessary in relation to surgery or a medical procedure.
(b) A medically important antimicrobial drug may also be used when, in the professional judgment of a licensed veterinarian, it is needed for prophylaxis to address an elevated risk of contraction of a particular disease or infection.
(c) A person shall not administer a medically important antimicrobial drug to livestock solely for purposes of promoting weight gain or improving feed efficiency.
(d) Unless the administration is consistent with subdivision (a), a person shall not administer a medically important antimicrobial drug in a regular pattern.
14403.
(a) Notwithstanding Sections 14401 and 14402 of this code and Article 15 (commencing with Section 4196) of Chapter 9 of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code, medically important antimicrobial drugs may be sold by retailers licensed pursuant to Article 5 (commencing with Section 14321) of Chapter 4 of Division 7 with a prescription or veterinary feed directive from a licensed veterinarian.
(b) This section shall not be construed to invalidate the requirement to obtain a prescription or veterinary feed directive to administer a medically important antimicrobial drug as required by Section 14401.
(c) The department may promulgate regulations to implement this section.
14404.
(a) The department, in consultation with the Veterinary Medical Board, the State Department of Public Health, universities, and cooperative extensions, shall develop antimicrobial stewardship guidelines and best management practices for veterinarians, as well as livestock owners and their employees who are involved with administering medically important antimicrobial drugs, on the proper use of medically important antimicrobial drugs for disease treatment, control, and prevention. The guidelines shall include scientifically validated practical alternatives to the use of medically important antimicrobial drugs, including, but not limited to, the introduction of effective vaccines and good hygiene and management practices.
(b) The department shall consult with livestock producers, licensed veterinarians, and any other relevant stakeholders on ensuring livestock timely access to treatment for producers in rural areas with limited access to veterinary care.
(c) For purposes of this section, “antimicrobial stewardship” is a commitment to do all of the following:
(1) To use medically important antimicrobial drugs only when necessary to treat, control, and, in some cases, prevent, disease.
(2) To select the appropriate medically important antimicrobial drug and the appropriate dose, duration, and route of administration.
(3) To use medically important antimicrobial drugs for the shortest duration necessary and to administer them to the fewest animals necessary.
14405.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department coordinate with the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal Food and Drug Administration, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to implement the expanded antimicrobial resistance surveillance efforts included in the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, and that the information gathered through this effort will help lead to a better understanding of the links between antimicrobial use patterns in livestock and the development of antimicrobial resistant bacterial infections.
(b) (1) The department shall gather information on medically important antimicrobial drug sales and usage, as well as antimicrobial resistant bacteria and livestock management practice data. Monitoring efforts shall not be duplicative of the National Animal Health Monitoring System and the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, and, to the extent feasible, the department shall coordinate with the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the federal Food and Drug Administration in the development of these efforts.
(2) In coordinating with the National Animal Health Monitoring System and the National Antimicrobial Resistant Monitoring System, the department shall gather representative samples from all of the following:
(A) California’s major livestock segments.
(B) Regions with considerable livestock production.
(C) Representative segments of the food production chain.
(c) The department shall work with willing participants to gather samples and shall consult with, and conduct outreach to, livestock producers, licensed veterinarians, and any other relevant stakeholders on the implementation of the monitoring efforts. Participation in this effort shall be done in a manner that does not breach veterinary-client-patient confidentiality laws.
(d) (1) The department shall report to the Legislature by January 1, 2019, the results of its outreach activities and monitoring efforts. The department shall advise the Legislature as to whether or not participation is sufficient to provide statistically relevant data. The report shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(2) This subdivision is inoperative on January 1, 2023, pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code.
(e) The department shall seek funds from federal, state, and other sources to implement this section.
(f) The department may promulgate regulations to implement this section.
14406.
The department has the authority to request and receive copies of veterinary feed directives from the livestock owner, veterinarian, or distributor to fully implement the provisions of this chapter.
14407.
Notwithstanding the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code), any information provided pursuant to this chapter and Section 14902.5, if that section is added by Senate Bill 770 of the 2015–16 Regular Session of the Legislature, shall be held confidential, and shall not be disclosed to any person or governmental agency, other than the department or the Veterinary Medical Board, for the purposes of enforcing the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act (Chapter 11 (commencing with Section 4800) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code), unless the data is aggregated to prevent the identification of an individual farm or business. Information may be shared with federal agencies so long as it is protected by the federal Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347).
14408.
(a) A person who violates this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) for each day a violation occurs.
(b) (1) For a second or subsequent violation, a person who violates this chapter shall be punishable by an administrative fine, levied by the secretary, in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) for each day a violation occurs.
(2) In addition to the administrative fine, the violator shall attend an educational program on the judicious use of medically important antimicrobial drugs that has been approved by the secretary. The violator shall successfully complete the program and provide proof to the secretary within 90 days from the occurrence of the violation.
(c) Subdivisions (a) and (b) do not apply to licensed veterinarians. If the Veterinary Medical Board determines that a veterinarian is in violation of the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act (Chapter 11 (commencing with Section 4800) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code), the veterinarian may be subject to disciplinary sanctions pursuant to the act.
(d) The moneys collected pursuant to this article shall be deposited into the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund and shall be available for expenditure upon appropriation by the Legislature.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 14407 to the Food and Agricultural Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to ensure the confidentiality of the information collected pursuant to this act and the integrity of that information for regulatory and enforcement purposes, it is necessary that this act take effect.","(1) Existing law regulates the distribution and use of livestock drugs, as defined, by the Secretary of Food and Agriculture. Existing law also requires a person to obtain a license from the secretary to manufacture, sell, distribute, or store commercial feed, including commercial feed containing drugs.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, prohibit the administration of medically important antimicrobial drugs, as defined, to livestock unless ordered by a licensed veterinarian through a prescription or veterinary feed directive pursuant to a veterinarian-client-patient relationship, as specified, and would prohibit the administration of a medically important antimicrobial drug to livestock solely for purposes of promoting weight gain or improving feed efficiency. The bill would require the Department of Food and Agriculture, in consultation with the Veterinary Medical Board, the State Department of Public Health, universities, and cooperative extensions, to develop antimicrobial stewardship guidelines and best management practices on the proper use of medically important antimicrobial drugs and would require the department to gather information on medically important antimicrobial drug sales and usage, antimicrobial resistant bacteria, and livestock management practice data. The bill would require information provided pursuant to those provisions to be held confidential, as specified. The bill would authorize the department to request and receive copies of veterinary feed directives from certain persons to implement the bill’s provisions. The bill would make a first violation of the bill’s provisions subject to a civil penalty of up to $250 for each day a violation occurs, and would make second and subsequent violations subject to an administrative fine of $500 for each day a violation occurs, except as specified.
(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to add Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 14400) to Division 7 of the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to livestock."

Existing law also requires POST to establish and keep updated a continuing education classroom training course relating to law enforcement interaction with developmentally disabled and mentally ill persons.
This bill would require POST to require field training officers who are instructors for the field training program to have at least 8 hours of crisis intervention behavioral health training, as specified. The bill would also require POST to require as part of its existing field training officer course, at least 4 hours of training relating to competencies of the field training program and police training program that addresses how to interact with persons with mental illness or intellectual disability, to be completed as specified.
By requiring local law enforcement field training officers to have at least 8 additional hours of training and imposing additional training costs on local law enforcement agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Existing federal law (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396p) requires state Medicaid programs to seek reimbursement from the estates of deceased Medicaid beneficiaries, or from any recipient of the decedent’s property by distribution or survival, for Medicaid paid services received on or after 55 years of age, unless specific exemptions or other limitations apply.
(2) Federal law requires states to collect for long-term services and supports for individuals 55 years of age or older, and gives states the option to collect for other health care services.
(3) Federal law permits states to collect from the surviving spouse of a Medi-Cal beneficiary, but does not require collection upon the passing of a spouse of a deceased Medi-Cal beneficiary.
(4) Federal law defines “estate” for purposes of estate recovery to include all real and personal property and other assets included within the individual’s estate, as defined for purposes of state probate law, and permits states to have a broader definition of estate.
(5) The State Medicaid Manual allows states to establish an undue hardship exemption from estate recovery for a homestead of “modest value,” defined as a home valued at 50 percent or less of the average price of homes in the county where the homestead is located as of the date of the beneficiary’s death.
(6) Estate recovery is unfair to low-income individuals who need Medi-Cal for basic health care coverage, is a deterrent to signing individuals up for Medi-Cal, and is counter to both state and federal efforts to enroll individuals into health care coverage.
(7) By recovering for health care services beyond what is required by federal law, California forces low-income individuals 55 years of age or older to choose between signing up for basic health care services and passing on their home and other limited assets they possess to their children.
(8) California’s estate recovery program undermines the idea of Medi-Cal as a health care entitlement program by essentially turning Medi-Cal coverage for basic medical services into a loan program, with collection taking place at death.
(9) Estate recovery unfairly places part of the burden of financing the cost of health care in Medi-Cal on the estates of deceased Medi-Cal beneficiaries with limited assets.
(10) Estate recovery is inequitable as other social and health care programs, such as tax-subsidized coverage through the California Health Benefit Exchange, commonly referred to as Covered California, and the broadly financed federal Medicare program, do not have estate recovery.
(11) California does not adequately inform individuals on how to obtain information on the amounts that will be collected from their estate, and charges individuals $25 to find out how much Medi-Cal has spent on their behalf.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature, with the enactment of this act, to do all of the following:
(1) Limit Medi-Cal estate recovery to only those services required to be collected for under federal law.
(2) Limit the definition of “estate” to include only the real and personal property and other assets required to be included within the definition of “estate” under federal law.
(3) Require the State Department of Health Care Services to implement the option in the State Medicaid Manual to waive its claim, as a substantial hardship, when the estate, subject to recovery, is a homestead of modest value.
(4) Prohibit recovery from the surviving spouse of a deceased Medi-Cal beneficiary.
(5) Ensure that Medi-Cal beneficiaries can easily and timely receive information about how much their estate will owe Medi-Cal when they die.

Section 14009.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
14009.5.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the department shall claim against the estate of the decedent, or against any recipient of the property of that decedent by distribution an amount equal to the payments for the health care services received or the value of the property received by any recipient from the decedent by distribution, whichever is less, only in either of the following circumstances:
(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), against the real property of a decedent who was an inpatient in a nursing facility in accordance with Section 1396p(b)(1)(A) of Title 42 of the United States Code.
(2) (A) The decedent was 55 years of age or older when the individual received health care services.
(B) The department shall not claim under this paragraph when there is any of the following:
(i) A surviving spouse.
(ii) A surviving child who is under 21 years of age.
(iii) A surviving child who is blind or permanently and totally disabled, within the meaning of Section 1614 of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1382c).
(b) (1) The department shall waive its claim, in whole or in part, if it determines that enforcement of the claim would result in substantial hardship to other dependents, heirs, or survivors of the individual against whose estate the claim exists.
(2) In determining the existence of substantial hardship, in addition to other factors considered by the department consistent with federal law and guidance, the department shall waive its claim when the estate subject to recovery is a homestead of modest value.
(3) The department shall notify individuals of the waiver provision and the opportunity for a hearing to establish that a waiver should be granted.
(c) If the department proposes and accepts a voluntary postdeath lien, the voluntary postdeath lien shall accrue interest at the rate equal to the
monthly average received
annual average rate earned
on investments in the Surplus Money Investment Fund
in the calendar year preceding the year in which the decedent died
or simple interest at 7 percent per annum, whichever is lower.
(d) (1) The department shall provide a current or former beneficiary, or his or her authorized representative designated under Section 14014.5, upon request, with the total amount of Medi-Cal expenses that have been paid on behalf of that beneficiary that would be recoverable under this section.
(2) A current or former beneficiary, or his or her authorized representative designated under Section 14014.5, shall receive, upon request, a copy of the information requested pursuant to this subdivision once per calendar year for a reasonable fee not to exceed five dollars ($5) if the current or former beneficiary meets either of the following descriptions:
(A) An individual who is 55 years of age or older when the individual received health care services.
(B) A permanently institutionalized individual who is an inpatient in a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for the intellectually disabled, or other medical institution.
(3) The department shall permit a beneficiary to request the information described in paragraph (1) through the Internet, by telephone, by mail, or through other commonly available electronic means.
(4) The department shall conspicuously post on its Internet Web site, a description of the methods by which a request under this subdivision may be made, including, but not limited to, the department’s telephone number and any addresses that may be used for this purpose. The department shall also include this information in its pamphlet for the Medi-Cal Estate Recovery Program and any other notices the department distributes to beneficiaries regarding estate recovery.
(5) Upon receiving a request for the information described in paragraph (1), the department shall provide the information requested within 90 days after receipt of the request.
(e) The following definitions shall govern the construction of this section:
(1) “Decedent” means a beneficiary who has received health care under this chapter or Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 14200) and who has died leaving property to others
either
through
distribution or survival.
distribution.
(2) “Dependents” includes, but is not limited to, immediate family or blood relatives of the decedent.
(3) “Estate” means all real and personal property and other assets that are required to be subject to a claim for recovery pursuant to Section 1396p(b)(4)(A) of Title 42 of the United States Code. “Estate” shall not include any other real and personal property or other assets in which the individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death, to the extent of that interest, consistent with Section 1396p(b)(4)(B) of Title 42 of the United States Code.
(4) “Health care services” means only those services required to be recovered under Section 1396p(b)(1)(B)(i) of Title 42 of the United States Code.
(5) “Homestead of modest value” means a home whose fair market value is 50 percent or less of the average price of homes in the county where the homestead is located, as of the date of the decedent’s death.
(f) The amendments made to this section by the act that added this subdivision shall apply only to individuals who die on or after January 1, 2016.","Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which qualified low-income persons receive health care benefits. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid provisions.
Existing federal law requires the state to seek adjustment or recovery from an individual’s estate for specified medical assistance, including nursing facility services, home and community-based services, and related hospital and prescription drug services, if the individual was 55 years of age or older when he or she received the medical assistance. Existing federal law allows the state, at its own option, to seek recovery for any items or services covered under the state’s Medicaid plan.
Existing state law, with certain exceptions, requires the department to claim against the estate of a decedent, or against any recipient of the property of that decedent by distribution or survival, an amount equal to the payments for Medi-Cal services received or the value of the property received by any recipient from the decedent by distribution or survival, whichever is less. Existing law provides for certain exemptions that restrict the department from filing a claim against a decedent’s property, including when there is a surviving spouse during his or her lifetime. Existing law requires the department, however, to make a claim upon the death of the surviving spouse, as prescribed. Existing law requires the department to waive its claim, in whole or in part, if it determines that enforcement of the claim would result in a substantial hardship, as specified. Existing law, which has been held invalid by existing case law, provides that the exemptions shall only apply to the proportionate share of the decedent’s estate or property that passes to those recipients, by survival or distribution, who qualify for the exemptions.
This bill would instead require the department to make these claims only in specified circumstances for those health care services that the state is required to recover under federal law, and would define health care services for these purposes. The bill would limit any claims against the estate of a decedent to only the real and personal property or other assets the state is required to seek recovery from under federal law. The bill would delete the proportionate share provision and would delete the requirement that the department make a claim upon the death of the surviving spouse. The bill would require the department to waive its claim when the estate subject to recovery is a homestead of modest value, as defined. The bill would limit the amount of interest that is entitled to accrue on a voluntary postdeath lien, as specified. The bill would also require the department to provide a current or former beneficiary, or his or her authorized representative, upon request, with the total amount of Medi-Cal expenses that have been paid on his or her behalf that would be recoverable under these provisions, as specified. The bill would apply the changes made by these provisions only to individuals who die on or after January 1, 2016.","An act to amend Section 14009.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to Medi-Cal."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because this act implements a federal law or regulation and results only in costs mandated by the federal government, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","The Political Reform Act of 1974 prohibits mass mailings from being sent at public expense. The act defines “mass mailing” as over 200 substantially similar pieces of mail, not including form letters or other mail, that are sent in response to an unsolicited request, letter, or other inquiry. Existing regulations of the Fair Political Practices Commission add further definitional criteria for mass mailings and specify certain exceptions to the act’s prohibition against mass mailings.
This bill would prohibit a mass mailing that complies with the Commission’s regulatory criteria from being sent within the 90 days preceding an election by or on behalf of a candidate whose name will appear on the ballot for a city, county, or special district elective office.
A willful violation of the act’s provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandate local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.
The federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) authorizes workforce investment activities, including activities in which states may participate. The federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), beginning July 1, 2015, repeals and supersedes the WIA and, among other things, requires a state, in order to receive specified allotments of federal funds and before the second full program year after July 22, 2014, to identify planning regions and require local boards and chief elected officials to prepare regional plans for those planning regions, as specified.
The California Workforce Investment Act requires the California Workforce Investment Board to develop and update a state workforce investment plan, as specified. Existing law requires each local board to develop and submit to the Governor a comprehensive 5-year local plan in partnership with the appropriate chief local elected officials that is consistent with the state workforce investment plan.
This bill would require the state, in conformity with WIOA and after consultation with local boards and chief elected officials, to identify planning regions. The bill would require local boards and chief elected officials to prepare regional plans for those planning regions, as specified. By imposing this requirement on local government, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require the board to aid the Governor in facilitating system alignment across the core programs of WIOA, as defined, and make related and conforming changes.

"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Article 3 (commencing with Section 115810) is added to Chapter 4 of Part 10 of Division 104 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:
Article  3. The Consideration of Alternatives for Artificial Turf Infill Act of 2016
115810.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Thousands of schools, parks, and local governments have installed artificial turf fields throughout the state. It has allowed them to use fields year round, save water, and save money, among other benefits.
(b) Not all artificial turf fields are made from the same materials. While most artificial turf fields use less expensive crumb rubber infill from groundup used car and truck tires, many companies now offer artificial turf infill alternatives made from coconut fibers, rice husks, cork, sand, or virgin crumb rubber. Organic alternative infills can help reduce synthetic turf field temperatures on hot days by as much as 30 degrees compared to crumb rubber infill from used tires.
(c) The average artificial turf field uses approximately 20,000 groundup used tires to make crumb rubber infill. Tires contain many chemicals including, but not limited to: 4-t-octylphenol, acetone, arsenic, barium, benzene, benzothiazole, butylated hydroxyanisole, cadmium, carbon black, chloroethane, chromium, latex, lead, manganese, mercury, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, n-hexadecane, naphthalene, nickel, nylon, phenol, phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and zinc.
(d) In 2008, then Attorney General Jerry Brown sued the nation’s largest makers and installers of artificial turf fields for excessive lead levels after testing by the Center for Environmental Health found high concentrations of lead in their products.
(e) In 2009, the Los Angeles Unified School District banned turf fields containing infill from waste tire crumb rubber and instead chose alternative infills for their artificial turf fields.
(f) In 2010, then Attorney General Jerry Brown settled the case with the nation’s largest makers and installers of artificial turf fields requiring them to reformulate their products to reduce lead levels and established the nation’s first enforceable standards applicable to lead in artificial turf.
(g) The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment’s 2010 study on used tire crumb rubber in artificial turf fields reviewed chemical concentrations in the air above the fields and found that eight chemicals appear on the California Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer. Exposure via inhalation to five of these chemicals (benzene, formaldehyde, naphthalene, nitromethane, and styrene) gave increased lifetime cancer risks that exceeded one in one million. According to the study, the highest risk was from nitromethane, which could cause about nine cancer cases in a hypothetical population of one million soccer players. The study also found that two additional identified chemicals (toluene and benzene) appear on the California Proposition 65 list as developmental/reproductive poisons.
(h) At least 10 studies since 2007, including those by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, have found potentially harmful lead levels in turf fibers and in rubber crumbs.
(i) A 2011 study titled, “An Evaluation of Potential Exposures to Lead and Other Metals as the Result of Aerosolized Particulate Matter from Artificial Turf Playing Fields” concluded that artificial turf can deteriorate to form dust containing lead at levels that may pose a risk to children.
(j) A 2012 study published in the scientific journal Chemosphere titled, “Hazardous organic chemicals in rubber recycled tire playgrounds and pavers”, showed the high content of toxic chemicals in these recycled materials and found that “uses of recycled rubber tires, especially those targeting play areas and other facilities for children, should be a matter of regulatory concern.”
(k) The Swedish Chemicals Agency found that waste tire crumb rubber contains several particularly hazardous substances and recommended that rubber granules from waste tires not be used in artificial turf.
(l) In 2013, The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) posted a disclaimer on the only limited study on tire crumb risk it had ever conducted. The EPA press release summarizing the study has been stamped with a notice that it was “outdated” and a new link has been appended to a statement stressing the need for “future studies” to enable “more comprehensive conclusions.”
(m) On May 19, 2015, the chair of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Elliot Kaye, testified before the United States Congress that he no longer stands behind a 2008 statement from the commission that crumb rubber is safe to play on. His testimony described new federal studies underway. The CPSC also ordered an enforcement review of marketing of artificial turf products for children because the commission found lead levels in artificial sports fields above statutory limits in children’s products.
(n) A June 2015, study conducted at Yale University by Environment and Human Health, Inc., an organization of physicians and public health professionals, found that crumb rubber infill from used tires contain at least 96 chemicals. Of the 96 chemicals detected, a little under one-half had no toxicity assessments done on them for their health effects. Of the one-half that had toxicity assessments, 20 percent were probable carcinogens and 40 percent were irritants. The carcinogens found were 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole, 9,10-Dimethylanthracene, Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, Fluoranthene, Heptadecane, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, Phenol, 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-, Phenanthrene Carcinogen - polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons, Phthalimide, Pyrene, 1-methyl-, Tetratriacontane, Pyrene, and Carbon Black. Of the irritants found, 24 percent were respiratory irritants, some causing asthma symptoms, 37 percent were skin irritants, and 27 percent were eye irritants.
(o) In June 2015, The Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery in collaboration with the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) agreed to spend nearly three million dollars ($3,000,000) to conduct a three-year study of potential health effects associated with the use of recycled waste tires in playground and artificial turf products. Making use of the toxicity criteria, monitoring data, and exposure pattern analysis results obtained in the study, OEHHA will conduct an assessment of potential health impacts associated with use of artificial turf and playground mats.
(p) While the public awaits the results of the OEHHA study and other studies being conducted at the national level and around the country, it is in the public’s best interest, especially from a children’s health perspective, that schools and local governments consider the various infill options when choosing to install artificial turf fields.
115810.1.
For purposes of this article, “crumb rubber infill” means any composition material that contains recycled crumb rubber from waste tires and is used to cover or surface an artificial turf field.
115810.2.

(1) (A) Gather information from companies that offer artificial turf products that do not use crumb rubber infill.
(B) For purposes of this paragraph, information shall include, but not be limited to, information obtained from discussions with at least one company that offers artificial turf products that do not contain crumb rubber infill.
(2) Consider the use of material that does not contain crumb rubber infill in its artificial turf field project based on the information gathered pursuant to paragraph (1).
(3) Hold a public meeting that includes as a properly noticed agenda item a discussion of the installation of crumb rubber infill, with an opportunity for public comment. Members of the public wishing to make a comment during the public meeting shall be permitted to do so consistent with the established comment procedure for the meeting.
(b) Subdivision (a) shall not apply to any installation of an artificial turf field containing crumb rubber infill that commenced, or any contract for such an installation entered into, prior to January 1, 2017.
(c) Subdivision (a) shall not apply to any maintenance that is needed on an artificial turf field containing crumb rubber infill in existence as of January 1, 2017, or that is installed consistent with subdivision (b).
115810.3.
This article shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.

This act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill within the meaning of subdivision (e) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, has been identified as related to the budget in the Budget Bill, and shall take effect immediately.","The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including certain credits that are allowed in modified conformity to credits allowed by federal income tax laws. Federal income tax laws allow a refundable earned income tax credit for certain low-income individuals who have earned income and who meet certain other requirements.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, would allow an earned income credit against personal income tax, and a payment in excess of that credit amount, to an eligible individual that is equal to that portion of the earned income tax credit allowed by federal law as determined by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor as set forth in the annual Budget Act.
Existing law requires any bill authorizing a new personal income tax credit to contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the tax credit will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements, as provided.
To measure whether the earned income credit achieves its intended purpose, this bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to annually prepare a specified written report and to provide that report to specified legislative committees.
Existing law establishes the continuously appropriated Tax Relief and Refund Account, and provides that payments required to be made to taxpayers or other persons from the Personal Income Tax Fund are to be paid from that account.
By authorizing new payments from that account for amounts in excess of personal income tax liabilities, this bill would make an appropriation.
The Personal Income Tax Law imposes taxes based upon taxable income and also imposes interest and penalties with regard to those taxes under specified circumstances, including a penalty for the underpayment of estimated tax. Existing law provides no addition to tax shall be imposed to the extent that the underpayment was created or increased by any law that is chaptered during and operative for the taxable year of the underpayment.
This bill would provide that addition to tax shall not be imposed if the applicable percentage for the earned income tax credit for the taxable year was less than the applicable percentage for that credit for the preceding taxable year and would impose a penalty, in conformity with federal law, for failure to be diligent in determining eligibility for the earned income tax credit, as specified.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.","An act to amend Sections 19136 and 19167 of, and to add Section 17052 to, the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, and making an appropriation therefor, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget."
